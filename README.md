JADE SIEBRA :rainbow:


* Hi, my name is Jade, I'm graduated in law school :flushed:, but I'm trying to find my away on the incredibly world of programming :sparkles:. 

* I consider myself a very calm and loving person, I'm aslo a huge fan of sports, like biking, I love animals and learning new things :grin:.


* So I'm basic a :alien: in this new world, but Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
