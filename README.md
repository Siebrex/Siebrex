# JADE SIEBRA :rainbow:


* Hi, my name is Jade, I'm graduated in law school :flushed:, but I'm trying to find my way on the incredible world of programming :sparkles:. 

* I consider myself a very calm and loving person, a huge fan of sports, passionate about biking, in love with animals and learning new things :grin:.


* So I'm basic an :alien: in this world. Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Java **on my own**.

* In 2022 I started a new adventure and I'm currently computer science college student. :computer:.

* Now IÂ´m looking for a internship to acquire more knowledge and practice.
